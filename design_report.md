# Design Report & Concept Note

## 1. Chunking Strategy
[To be filled during Phase 1: Will explain Recursive Character chunking with specific overlap parameters to preserve financial context.]

## 2. LLM Choice & Local Hosting
[To be filled during Phase 3: Will justify Llama-3-8B-Instruct with 4-bit quantization for balance of instruction adherence and Colab GPU constraints.]

## 3. Re-ranker Justification
[To be filled during Phase 2: Will explain the use of a Cross-Encoder to boost semantic precision over standard cosine similarity.]

## 4. Handling Out-of-Scope & "Not Specified"
[To be filled during Phase 3: Will detail the prompt engineering techniques used to strictly bound the LLM's knowledge to the retrieved context.]
